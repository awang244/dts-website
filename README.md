# Drawn to Scale A Cappella Website

When you're done making changes and stuff just push to master and then do:

```
ssh dts@ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu
```

Ask a previous webmaster for the password. If you don't wanna enter the password every time just put your public key on a new line inside `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Then,

```
cd ~/public_html
git pull
```

and you should see all your changes on drawntoscale.berkeley.edu
