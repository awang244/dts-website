                       <p>Taylor spends most of her time singing, humming, speaking, and just generally being as loud as humanly possible. When there is no one around to hear her, she turns to her online audience, delighting her fans with mediocre blog posts and Superwholock crossover fanfiction. Taylor wants to smash the patriarchy one day, but not right now because she’s <i>super</i> busy.</p>

Unfortunately, she is not actually human, but a shapeless amoeba made up of 70% black coffee and 30% useless celebrity gossip. Her favorite hobby is laughing uncontrollably at jokes that aren’t even that funny. Also, she once ate the heart of a chicken. It was kinda chewy. Taylor Swift is her aural pleasure.</p>

No. But besides being a housewife in my spare time, I also gym. I love to sing, read, and think, though the latter is heavily debatable. My spirit animal is Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>

                       <p>Arthur is the only graduate student of DtS. Probably because he's French and "understand not very good English", he doesn't realize that it's a bit offbeat for a grad to hang out with a group of Glee-fans undergrads and he even seems to appreciate it. Spontaneous and usually quiet, Arthur sometimes has to moderate the vibrato he acquired during its five years of classical chorale in France. Arthur likes playing the piano for hours, reading intellectual novels that he doesn't really understand, going to contemporary art fairs and travelling to very far away countries to take thousands of photos. <br><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>NOT ALL DTS MEMBERS ARE GLEE FANS!</p>

                       <p>Hayley, though anatomically human, was raised by feral cats until the age of 18.  Among felines she learned the importance of personal hygiene, the art of appearing aloof, and sleeping for extended periods of time.  Now a student at UC Berkeley, she lives among humans and has fully assimilated into their culture.   She spends her days eating burritos, playing pool, and listening to the album “Led Zeppelin IV” on repeat.</p>

                       <p>Definitely the most clueless member of DtS, Rachel recently sacrificed her life to CS and is now eternally bound to spend the majority of her remaining time on Earth in front of a computer. In addition to annoying her roommates with impromptu dorm karaoke sessions, Rachel enjoys pretending like she knows what she’s doing on a daily basis. She also may be the only member of DtS who can’t read music (yet).</p>

                       <p>Spawn of the underworld, Michael loves tearing off pieces of his old math notebooks and feeding them to his pet turtles. Besides making odd sounds with his mouth, Michael also enjoys swimming in the shallow end of pools and calculating the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Michael's dream is to win the DtS superlative for Biggest Hair.</p>
